Welcome to PhotoShare!

PhotoShare contains both a web frontend and a iOS application(currently in the works). The application is all tied together using rails backend for storing data and firebase for storing images. The idea of the application is to allow users to share images and allow other users to comment on those images and share their thoughts!

IMPORTANT NOTE:
As of right now I have my firebase configuration in my javascript files. This means that unfortunately you will not be able to run my project without it. I am in the process of moving my authentication to my backend in which I will then host this live. Hence as of right now my project is currently setup to pass my phase 4 review at flatiron school and will continue to work on this when I begin react and will eventually move this application live.
